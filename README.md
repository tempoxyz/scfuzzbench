## Motivation

- Maintain a current view of common fuzzers under a shared, realistic workload.
- Focus on benchmark quality with real projects, real bug-finding tasks, long timeouts, and repeated runs.
- Publish transparent metrics and artifacts for independent review.
- Help fuzzer/tool builders identify bottlenecks and improve their tools.

## Inclusion Criteria For Fuzzers

A fuzzer is currently considered in-scope when it is:

- Open source.
- Able to run assertion failures.
- Able to run global invariants.

## Fuzzers Currently Ready

- Foundry
- Echidna
- Medusa
- Recon Fuzzer

## Benchmark Targets

- [Aave v4](https://github.com/Recon-Fuzz/aave-v4-scfuzzbench)
- [Superform v2-periphery](https://github.com/Recon-Fuzz/superform-v2-periphery-scfuzzbench)
- [Liquity v2 Governance](https://github.com/Recon-Fuzz/liquity-V2-gov-scfuzzbench)
- [Nerite](https://github.com/Recon-Fuzz/nerite-scfuzzbench)

Use the target onboarding skill for new targets:

- `skills/README.md`
- `skills/target-onboarding/SKILL.md`

## Documentation

For all technical/operational details, use the docs site pages:

- Introduction: `docs/introduction.md`
- Start benchmark request: `docs/start.md`
- Methodology: `docs/methodology.md`
- Operations guide (Terraform, running, reruns, analysis, CI workflows): `docs/operations.md`
- Target onboarding skill (machine-oriented): `skills/target-onboarding/SKILL.md`

Rendered docs navigation and run/benchmark pages are available under `docs/`.
