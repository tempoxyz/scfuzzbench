# Methodology

This page documents the current benchmarking methodology used by `scfuzzbench`.

## Objectives

- Run different fuzzers under equivalent infrastructure and runtime constraints.
- Pin versions and inputs so runs are reproducible.
- Publish enough raw and processed artifacts for independent inspection.
- Use robust, distribution-aware reporting across repeated runs.

## End-to-End Benchmark Flow

### 1) Define and pin benchmark inputs

Core inputs are defined through Terraform vars and/or workflow dispatch:

- Target: `target_repo_url`, `target_commit`
- Mode: `benchmark_type` (`property` or `optimization`)
- Infra: `instance_type`, `instances_per_fuzzer`, `timeout_hours`
- Fuzzer set: `fuzzers` (or default all available)
- Tool versions: `foundry_version`, `echidna_version`, `medusa_version`, `recon_version`

In CI (`.github/workflows/benchmark-run.yml`), inputs are validated before apply (value ranges, formats, and conservative character constraints).

### 2) Compute run identity and benchmark identity

Terraform computes two IDs used across the pipeline:

- `run_id`:
  - Explicit `var.run_id` if provided.
  - Otherwise `time_static.run.unix` (state-stable; repeated applies can reuse it).
- `benchmark_uuid`:
  - `md5(jsonencode(benchmark_manifest))` in `infrastructure/main.tf`.

`benchmark_manifest` includes pinned context such as:

- `scfuzzbench_commit`, `target_repo_url`, `target_commit`
- `benchmark_type`, `instance_type`, `instances_per_fuzzer`, `timeout_hours`
- `aws_region`, `ubuntu_ami_id`
- tool versions and selected `fuzzer_keys`

This means changing any of those manifest fields changes `benchmark_uuid`.

### 3) Provision equivalent runners

Terraform provisions one EC2 instance per `(fuzzer, run_index)` pair:

- Same AMI family for all (`ubuntu_ami_ssm_parameter`).
- Same instance type and timeout budget for all fuzzers in a run.
- AZ auto-selected from offering data for the requested instance type (unless `availability_zone` is explicitly set).
- `user_data_replace_on_change = true` so runner behavior changes trigger replacement.

### 4) Execute benchmark on each runner

Runner lifecycle is defined in `infrastructure/user_data.sh.tftpl` and `fuzzers/_shared/common.sh`:

- Install only that runner's fuzzer implementation (`fuzzers/<name>/install.sh`).
- Clone target repository and checkout the pinned commit.
- Build with `forge build`.
- Run fuzzer command under `timeout` (`SCFUZZBENCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`).
- Collect host metrics periodically into `runner_metrics.csv` (enabled by default).
- Upload artifacts to S3, then self-shutdown.

Instances are intentionally one-shot:

- A bootstrap sentinel (`/opt/scfuzzbench/.bootstrapped`) avoids accidental reruns after reboot.
- Shutdown occurs even on failures via trap/finalizer handling.

### 5) Benchmark type switching

`benchmark_type` behavior is applied by `apply_benchmark_type` in `fuzzers/_shared/common.sh`:

- Uses `SCFUZZBENCH_PROPERTIES_PATH` from `fuzzer_env` to locate the properties contract.
- Applies deterministic `sed` transforms for `property` vs `optimization` mode.
- If `optimization` is requested but required markers/files are missing, the run fails early.

### 6) Upload and index artifacts

Each instance uploads:

- Logs zip: `s3://<bucket>/logs/<run_id>/<benchmark_uuid>/i-...-<fuzzer>.zip`
- Optional corpus zip: `s3://<bucket>/corpus/<run_id>/<benchmark_uuid>/i-...-<fuzzer>.zip`
- Benchmark manifest:
  - `logs/<run_id>/<benchmark_uuid>/manifest.json`
  - `runs/<run_id>/<benchmark_uuid>/manifest.json` (timestamp-first index used by docs)

## What Counts as a Complete Run

Docs and release automation use the same completion rule:

- `now >= run_id + (timeout_hours * 3600) + 3600`

Notes:

- `run_id` is interpreted as a Unix timestamp.
- `timeout_hours` comes from `manifest.json` (default `24` if missing).
- `3600` is a fixed 1-hour grace window.

This rule is implemented in:

- `scripts/generate_docs_site.py`
- `.github/workflows/benchmark-release.yml`

Only complete runs are listed as benchmark results pages.

## Analysis and Reporting Methodology

### Canonical analysis pipeline

The default full pipeline is:

```bash
make results-analyze-all BUCKET=... RUN_ID=... BENCHMARK_UUID=... DEST=...
```

This expands to:

1. Download logs/corpus bundles (`scripts/download_run_artifacts.py`)
2. Collect `*.log` files, runner metrics, and Foundry showmap artifacts into analysis layout (`scripts/prepare_analysis_logs.py`)
3. Parse events, summaries, and differential coverage artifacts (`scripts/run_analysis_filtered.py` -> `analysis/analyze.py`)
4. Convert event stream to cumulative series (`analysis/events_to_cumulative.py`)
5. Build report + charts (`analysis/benchmark_report.py`)
6. Build broken-invariant overlap artifacts (`analysis/invariant_overlap_report.py`)
7. Build runner CPU/memory artifacts (`analysis/runner_metrics_report.py`)

Optional controls include `EXCLUDE_FUZZERS`, `REPORT_BUDGET`, `REPORT_GRID_STEP_MIN`, `REPORT_CHECKPOINTS`, `REPORT_KS`, `INVARIANT_TOP_K`, and `RUNNER_METRICS_BIN_SECONDS`.

### Event extraction semantics (`analysis/analyze.py`)

- Parser is fuzzer-aware:
  - Foundry: parse JSON lines, count events only from records with `event=failure`, and use the first JSON `timestamp` as the elapsed-time baseline.
  - Medusa: parse elapsed markers and failed assertions/properties from textual logs.
  - Echidna and Recon Fuzzer: parse falsification markers from textual logs.
  - Unknown fuzzers: fall back to generic pattern parsing.
- Event de-duplication is per run-instance stream (same event name counted once per run).
- Outputs:
  - `events.csv` (raw event stream)
  - `summary.csv` (run-level aggregates)
  - `overlap.csv` (cross-fuzzer Jaccard overlap)
  - `exclusive.csv` (events found by exactly one fuzzer)
  - `throughput_samples.csv` (raw tx/s and gas/s samples recovered from logs when available)
  - `throughput_summary.csv` (per-fuzzer tx/s and gas/s distribution summary)
  - `progress_metrics_samples.csv` (raw fuzzer-native progress metrics such as seq/s, coverage proxy, corpus size, favored items, failure rate when available)
  - `progress_metrics_summary.csv` (per-fuzzer distribution summary of those progress metrics)
  - `differential_coverage_summary.csv` (human-readable baseline/feature verdicts computed from per-sample relscore statistics and relcov confidence intervals)
  - `differential_coverage_statistics.json` (machine-readable verdict inputs, per-campaign test results, intervals, sample counts, and aggregate verdict)
  - `differential_coverage_relscores.csv` (relscore values computed from normalized AFL showmap campaigns)
  - `differential_coverage_relcov.csv` (pairwise non-self relcov values computed from normalized AFL showmap campaigns)
  - `showmap_campaign_manifest.json` (raw showmap inputs, skipped inputs, and normalized campaign summaries)
  - `showmap_campaigns/` (canonical `approach/trial.txt` campaign directories used for relscore scoring)

### Differential coverage from Foundry showmap

- Foundry runs emit AFL `showmap`-style coverage files under the uploaded log artifact when the installed `forge` supports `forge test --showmap-out`.
- Raw Foundry replay output may use `approach__suite/trial.txt` for invariant replay and `approach__suite__test/trial.txt` for fuzz-test replay.
- `scripts/prepare_analysis_logs.py` preserves uploaded `showmap/` trees beside each prepared instance log directory.
- Analysis normalizes raw Foundry showmap output into canonical campaign directories before scoring:
  - `showmap_campaigns/combined/<approach>/<trial>.txt` unions all showmap files for each trial.
  - `showmap_campaigns/by_test/<suite-test>/<approach>/<trial>.txt` preserves per-test drill-down campaigns.
- Relscore and relcov are computed through the `differential-coverage` package from normalized AFL showmap campaign directories. Only positive AFL showmap counts are treated as covered edges.
- When a campaign has one baseline approach (`master`, `main`, `stable`, or a `*-master`/`*-main` label) and one feature approach, `differential_coverage_summary.csv` records separate `relscore` and `relcov` metric rows with the same reported verdict:
  - `improvement`: relscore is significantly higher after target-family Holm correction, the effect size is meaningful, and the lower bound of the relcov bootstrap interval holds the configured floor.
  - `needs-review`: relscore is significantly higher but relcov is uncertain or shows a coverage shift.
  - `regression`: relscore is significantly lower, or the upper bound of the relcov bootstrap interval is below the configured floor.
  - `inconclusive`: the result is not significant after correction, has too few samples, is missing required seed pairs, or has insufficient samples for the confidence intervals.
- Low-run campaigns still report point relscore, relcov, pairing rate, and sample counts, but the verdict is `inconclusive` with a `verdict_reason` such as `too few runs`.
- Differential coverage has an explicit pairing mode. `unpaired` treats repeated
  rounds as independent samples. `paired` requires matching seed-labeled trials
  across arms and refuses silent fallback to an unpaired test when matches are
  absent.
- Multi-target CI tags each trial with its target before differential coverage
  analysis. `differential_coverage_summary.csv` then includes `by_target/<name>`
  campaign rows before any Slack status rendering. Aggregate status is only an
  improvement when a majority of targets improve and no target regresses; any
  target regression blocks an aggregate improvement.
- `SCFUZZBENCH_FOUNDRY_SHOWMAP=0` disables Foundry showmap collection. `FOUNDRY_SHOWMAP_DOMAIN`, `FOUNDRY_SHOWMAP_CORPUS_DIR`, and `SCFUZZBENCH_FOUNDRY_SHOWMAP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` tune replay behavior. When no corpus override is set, showmap replay lets `forge` resolve the corpus directories from the target's Foundry config. Replay timeout defaults to the smaller of the campaign timeout and 1800 seconds so showmap collection stays within the benchmark completion grace window unless explicitly overridden.

### Cumulative conversion (`analysis/events_to_cumulative.py`)

- Produces long-form CSV: `fuzzer, run_id, time_hours, bugs_found`.
- Run keys are stabilized as `run_id:instance_id`.
- When `--logs-dir` is provided, runs with zero detected events still emit a time `0` row (unless `--no-zero`).

### Report generation (`analysis/benchmark_report.py`)

- Validates each run's cumulative sequence:
  - non-decreasing time
  - non-decreasing integer bug counts
  - non-negative counts
- Resamples all runs onto a common forward-filled time grid (`REPORT_GRID_STEP_MIN`, default 6 min).
- Computes distribution-oriented metrics per fuzzer:
  - checkpoint medians + IQR
  - normalized AUC
  - plateau time
  - late discovery share
  - time-to-k median + reach rate
  - final distribution (median + IQR)
- Note: these report scorecards are count-based. They do not score severity or root-cause uniqueness.
- If `throughput_summary.csv` is present, the report also includes tx/s and gas/s summary tables.
- If `throughput_samples.csv` is present, the report also emits throughput trend charts (`tx_per_second_over_time.png`, `gas_per_second_over_time.png`).
- If `progress_metrics_summary.csv` is present, the report also includes per-fuzzer progress proxy tables (seq/s, coverage, corpus, favored, failure rate) and progress-metrics summary charts.
- If `progress_metrics_samples.csv` is present, the report also emits progress trend charts (`seq_per_second_over_time.png`, `coverage_proxy_over_time.png`, `corpus_size_over_time.png`, `favored_items_over_time.png`, `failure_rate_over_time.png`).
- Emits:
  - `REPORT.md`
  - `bugs_over_time.png`
  - `time_to_k.png`
  - `final_distribution.png`
  - `plateau_and_late_share.png`

If input CSV is empty, the report explicitly records the no-data condition and emits placeholder plots.

### Broken-invariant overlap (`analysis/invariant_overlap_report.py`)

- Uses `events.csv` (optionally budget-filtered) to summarize which invariant/event names were observed.
- Emits:
  - `broken_invariants.md`
  - `broken_invariants.csv`
  - `invariant_overlap_upset.png`
- These artifacts provide per-fuzzer totals, exclusives, shared subsets, and normalized invariant labels.
- Important interpretation note: UpSet overlap is approximate, not exact root-cause equivalence.
  - Two assertions inside one target function can represent distinct bugs (for example, one in the `try` success path vs one in the `catch` path, where one indicates an unexpected successful-result condition and the other indicates a DoS/revert behavior).
  - Foundry-side assertion surfacing depends on the current `foundry-rs/foundry#13322` behavior (<https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/13322>), so normalized overlap should be read as an approximation.
  - Even in Echidna vs Medusa comparisons, overlap is still approximate: Echidna may falsify `assert(x != y)` while Medusa falsifies `assert(a != b)` in the same target-function body, which are distinct bugs even if function-level normalization groups them together.
- UpSet chart layout follows: Lex A, Gehlenborg N, Strobelt H, Vuillemot R, Pfister H. *UpSet: Visualization of Intersecting Sets*. IEEE TVCG 20(12), 2014 ([doi:10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346248](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346248)).

### Runner resource reporting (`analysis/runner_metrics_report.py`)

- Uses `runner_metrics*.csv` files collected on each runner to summarize host resource usage over time.
- Emits:
  - `runner_resource_usage.md`
  - `runner_resource_summary.csv`
  - `runner_resource_timeseries.csv`
  - `cpu_usage_over_time.png`
  - `memory_usage_over_time.png`
- CPU is reported as active percentage (`user + system + iowait`) and memory is reported as used percentage/GiB.

## Publication and Release

`Benchmark Release` workflow:

- Discovers complete runs automatically (or accepts explicit `benchmark_uuid` + `run_id`).
- Runs the same analysis pipeline in CI.
- Publishes analysis artifacts to:
  - `s3://<bucket>/analysis/<benchmark_uuid>/<run_id>/...`
- Creates a GitHub release tag:
  - `scfuzzbench-<benchmark_uuid>-<run_id>`

The docs site also supports legacy analysis under `reports/<benchmark_uuid>/<run_id>/`, but new runs should use `analysis/...`.

## Missing Analysis Triage

If a run is complete but shows missing analysis:

1. Re-run GitHub Actions `Benchmark Release` for that `benchmark_uuid` + `run_id`.
2. Or run analysis locally and upload artifacts to `analysis/<benchmark_uuid>/<run_id>/`.
3. If the run is junk, delete its S3 prefixes (`runs/`, `logs/`, optional `corpus/`, partial `analysis/`).

These runs remain visible in docs to support triage.

## Choosing Target Projects

Issue reference: <https://github.com/Recon-Fuzz/scfuzzbench/issues/8>  
Guideline source: <https://github.com/fuzz-evaluator/guidelines>

Target selection should follow guideline items A.2.2-A.2.5:

- A.2.2: select a representative set from the target domain.
- A.2.3: include targets used by related work for comparability.
- A.2.4: do not cherry-pick targets based on preliminary outcomes.
- A.2.5: avoid overlapping codebases with substantial shared code.

Recommended operational policy for this repository:

1. Freeze the target list before benchmark execution.
2. Pin each target to an immutable commit.
3. Record a rationale for each target (why it improves representativeness).
4. Include related-work targets where feasible, and cite source papers/benchmarks.
5. Track overlap groups (for forks/wrappers/shared-core code) and keep only one representative per overlap group unless explicitly justified.
6. Keep the selection manifest in-repo so additions/removals are reviewable.

Suggested manifest fields per target:

- repository URL
- pinned commit
- properties path (`SCFUZZBENCH_PROPERTIES_PATH`)
- benchmark mode(s) intended
- rationale
- related-work reference(s)
- overlap group / exclusion notes

## Caveats and Reproducibility Notes

- `timeout_hours` applies to fuzzer execution; clone/build/setup occur before timed fuzzing starts.
- Re-running Terraform without changing state can reuse `time_static` `run_id`; set explicit `run_id` for distinct runs.
- Bucket defaults allow public object read (`bucket_public_read=true`) so docs/releases can link directly to S3 artifacts.
- Keep secrets out of Terraform vars and docs; use SSM or environment-based secret handling.
